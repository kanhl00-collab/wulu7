# Assignment 3
## Control:
- Left and right arrow kayes to rotate around y axis
- Up and down to move camera up and down
- C and V to rotate around x axis
- N and M to rotate around z axis
- Z and X to zoom in and out
- W to toggle between solid, wireframe, and both
- L to enable lighting
- R to regenerate terrain
- S to toggle between triangle strips and quad strips
- A to toggle between circle, fault and midpoint displacement algorithm. Aftering changing algorithm, remember to **hit R** to apply the new algorithm!!
- F to toggle between flat shading and Gouraud shading in lighting mode
- e, t, y, u, i, g to move light1 position
- h, j, k, b, o, p to move light2 position
- Q to quit

## Camera:
ratate around xyz axis, zoom in/out

## Lighting:
default is vector normals, flat shading and Garound shading available

## Algorithm:
circle algorithm is default, fault and midpoint displacement available
